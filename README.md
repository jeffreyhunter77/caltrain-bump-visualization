# Bump Report

This is a data visualization work in progress showing data as reported through [SFBC's bump report form](http://sfbike.org/bump).

# Things to do:

 * ~~Set up unit tests~~
 * Refactor / separate out some code
 * Implement real mouse-over state
 * ~~Fetch live data from a google spreadsheet~~
